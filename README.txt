Instructions:
1. Place your Amma BGM MP3 files (e.g., amma.mp3 and amma2.mp3) in the same folder as these files.
2. Open index.html in a browser. For mobile browsers, autoplay is often blocked unless the user interacts with the page â€” use the play button.
3. Use the 'Shuffle' button to randomize the playlist.
4. You can drag & drop audio files onto the page to load them directly (no file upload required).
5. To customize the letter text, edit index.html in the <article class="content"> section.
